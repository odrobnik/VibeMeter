// This file just re-exports the protocols from the test utilities
// The actual protocols are defined in VibeMeterTests/TestUtilities/WebViewMock.swift
// and are reused here to avoid duplication

// Note: The WebViewContract and HTTPCookieStoreContract protocols are defined in
// VibeMeterTests/TestUtilities/WebViewMock.swift
// This separation ensures the protocols can be used both in main app code and tests.
